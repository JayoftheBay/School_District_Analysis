# School_District_Analysis: Academic Dishonesty Audit
 
 
## Introduction
The purpose of this district grade analysis is to help us find a verdict on if the Thomas High School ninth graders showed a case of academic dishonesty. This analysis allows us to compare the change in grades in reading and math scores for all schools in the district and grade levels.
 
## Results
Here are the results that we were able to conclude:
 
* How is this district summary affected?
    - Before answering this question, it is worth mentioning that the nine grade student body for THS is 461, which is 1.17% of the entire school district.
    -That being said, math passing percentage decreased .2%, reading passing percentage decreased .1%, and overall passing percentage decreased .3%.
* How is the school summary?
    - The school summary brings to light a huge change, math passing percentage decreased .09%, reading passing percentage decreased .3%, and overall passing percentage decreased .31%.
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
    - We can see that the relative performance of the school compared to its peers is stagnant, THS is still the second best school based on overall pass rate.
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    - Math and reading scores by grade
        >The key thing we can notice in this screen is that THS ninth graders are on par with their upper classmate.
    - Scores by school spending
        >No Change
    - Scores by school size
        >No Change
    - Scores by school type
        >No Change
## Summary
Based on the information we gathered, we can conclude that the nine graders at THS did not show any indication of academic dishonesty. The school has an overall high test score compared to other schools in the district. Arguably speaking, considering ninth grade should be easier then the higher grade levels the subtle dip in passing grades is not significant. There could be many outside forces that can affect such a small change. If more due diligence is needed on this topic, we should drop all ninth graders in the district to see if that drops the statistics. If so then we may have a case of academic dishonesty, if not, this analysis has concluded that the ninth graders in THS were not academically dishonest.
